# HLA_GEL

## ANALYSIS PLAN
1. find all HLA files
2. merge HLA files 
3. make some descriptive overviews
   1. demographics:
      1. age
      2. gender
      3. programme
      4. participant type
      5. ethnicity
      6. registered GMC trust
4. make HLA descriptive overview
   1. number of different HLA alleles per gene
   2. hwo much variance explaines by:
      1. ethnicity (reported or PCA)
      2. geographical position (aka registered trust)
      3. age
      4. gender
5. comparison of HLA freqs with other UK numbers
   1. [High resolution HLA haplotyping by imputation for a British population
bioresource](literature/1-s2.0-S0198885917300150-main.pdf) - Oxford, 2017
6. make outcomes
   1. identify schizophrenia patients
   2. identify patients with any anti-LGI1 AE codes
7. Association test
   1. logistic model
   2. null model without HLA alleles
      1. how much variance is explained by other factors
      2. which are the most important other factors?
8.
